# The Role of Callbacks

Callbacks are the foundation of asynchronous JavaScript. They are functions passed into other functions as arguments, which are then invoked to continue execution after the asynchronous operation completes.

Consider the example of using `setTimeout`, which delays a task. In the snippet below, `setTimeout` is used to delay a greeting message by two seconds:

```javascript
function displayMessage() {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
}

setTimeout(displayMessage, 2000);
```

However, extensive use of callbacks can lead to "callback hell," where multiple nested callbacks make the code hard to read and maintain.
