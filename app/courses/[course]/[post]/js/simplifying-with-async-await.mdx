# Simplifying with async/await

`async` and `await` further simplify working with promises, making asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code. Here's how you could use `async/await` to fetch data from an API:

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
    try {
        let response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
        let data = await response.json();
        console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Failed to fetch data:", error);
    }
}

fetchData();
```

This function fetches data from an API and logs it, handling any errors that might occur during the fetch operation.
