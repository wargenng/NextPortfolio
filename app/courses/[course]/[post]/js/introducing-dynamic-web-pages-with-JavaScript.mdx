## Week 2: Diving Into JavaScript – Adding Interactivity to Your Web Pages

Welcome to Week 2 of our journey into web development! Last week, we laid the foundation with HTML, and this week, we're going to bring those pages to life with JavaScript. By the end of this session, you'll understand how to use JavaScript to add dynamic content and respond to user events. Let's get started!

### Understanding JavaScript's Role

**What is JavaScript?** It's a powerful scripting language used to create dynamic content on websites. This means anything that moves, updates, or changes on your page without needing to reload it—like a popup message or a live feed—uses JavaScript.

### Setting Up Your Environment

First, let’s see how to incorporate JavaScript into your HTML pages. You can either embed scripts directly within your HTML using `<script>` tags or link to an external `.js` file. Here's how you link a JavaScript file:

```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

### JavaScript Basics

#### Variables and Data Types

Variables are like containers for storing data. In JavaScript, you use `let` or `const` to declare them:

```javascript
let message = "Hello, world!";
const pi = 3.14;
```

We primarily deal with types like strings, numbers, and booleans:

```javascript
let name = "John";
let age = 30;
let isStudent = true;
```

#### Simple Operations

You can perform operations like addition or combine variables:

```javascript
let sum = 10 + 5; // 15
let greeting = name + " is " + age + " years old.";
```

### Functions and Event Handlers

A function in JavaScript is a block of code designed to perform a specific task:

```javascript
function showMessage() {
    alert("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
```

And you can execute this function in response to an event, like a button click:

```html
<button onclick="showMessage()">Click me</button>
```

### Hands-On Activity: Interactive Elements

Now, let's add some interactive features. We'll make a button that changes the text in a div element when clicked:

```javascript
function updateDiv() {
    document.getElementById("myDiv").innerHTML = "Updated text!";
}
```

```html
<div id="myDiv">Original Text</div>
<button onclick="updateDiv()">Change Text</button>
```

### Practical Exercise: Toggle Visibility

A common feature on many websites is toggling the visibility of elements. Here's how you can hide and show a paragraph using JavaScript:

```javascript
function toggleParagraph() {
    var p = document.getElementById("myPara");
    if (p.style.display === "none") {
        p.style.display = "block";
    } else {
        p.style.display = "none";
    }
}
```

```html
<p id="myPara">This is a paragraph that will be hidden or shown.</p>
<button onclick="toggleParagraph()">Toggle Paragraph</button>
```

### Wrapping Up

As we wrap up today's session, experiment by adding different interactive elements to your pages. Try changing colors, displaying messages, or even playing sounds. JavaScript opens up a plethora of possibilities, so dive in and see what you can create!

### Homework Challenge

For your homework, continue to explore JavaScript by adding a feature that displays the current date and time on your page. Here’s a hint on how to start:

```javascript
function showDate() {
    document.getElementById("date").innerHTML = new Date();
}
```

Remember, the more you practice, the more comfortable you'll become. Happy coding!
