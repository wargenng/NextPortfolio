# Practical Applications

A practical application of these concepts is creating a user interface that displays data fetched from an API. For instance, you could build a simple web application that retrieves and displays user data without refreshing the page:

```javascript
async function displayUserData() {
    try {
        let userData = await fetch("https://api.example.com/user");
        let user = await userData.json();
        document.getElementById("userName").textContent = user.name;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error fetching user data:", error);
    }
}

displayUserData();
```

This application would update the UI with user data fetched asynchronously, providing a seamless experience for the user.
