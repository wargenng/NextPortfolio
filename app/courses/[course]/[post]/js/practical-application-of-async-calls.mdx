# Practical Applications of `async`/`await` with Real API Data

Using `async`/`await` to interact with real-world APIs can greatly simplify the process of fetching and displaying data in your web applications. Below, I'll provide a detailed example using both the JSONPlaceholder API, as already described, and another example using the Pokémon API (PokeAPI), which is a fun and public API that provides data about Pokémon.

### Example 1: Fetching User Data from JSONPlaceholder

The following function uses `async`/`await` to fetch user data from JSONPlaceholder and displays it on a webpage:

```javascript
async function displayUserData() {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(
            "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1"
        );
        const user = await response.json();
        document.getElementById("userName").textContent = user.name;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error fetching user data:", error);
    }
}

displayUserData();
```

**Key Points:**

-   **Fetch Request:** `fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1')` sends a request to get user data.
-   **Error Handling:** Errors in the fetch request or in parsing the response are caught and logged.
-   **DOM Manipulation:** The user's name is displayed dynamically on the webpage using `document.getElementById('userName').textContent`.

### Example 2: Fetching Pokémon Data from PokeAPI

Now let’s apply similar concepts to fetch data about a specific Pokémon using the PokeAPI:

```javascript
async function displayPokemonData() {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(
            "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/pikachu"
        ); // Fetch data about Pikachu
        const pokemon = await response.json();
        document.getElementById("pokemonName").textContent = pokemon.name; // Display the name
        document.getElementById("pokemonImage").src =
            pokemon.sprites.front_default; // Display an image
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error fetching Pokémon data:", error);
    }
}

displayPokemonData();
```

**Key Points:**

-   **Fetch Request:** `fetch('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/pikachu')` sends a request to get data about Pikachu.
-   **JSON Parsing:** The response is parsed to extract detailed information about Pikachu, including images available in the `sprites` object.
-   **DOM Updates:** The Pokémon’s name and image are dynamically displayed on the webpage, using the IDs `pokemonName` and `pokemonImage`.

### Enhancing the Code with Error Handling

For both examples, implementing robust error handling is crucial. The `try...catch` block captures errors that might occur during the network request or while handling the data. This is important because it helps prevent the application from crashing and provides feedback on what went wrong, improving the user experience.

### Practical Tips for Using `async`/`await` with APIs

-   **Check API Limits:** Some APIs like PokeAPI have rate limits. Make sure your application respects these limits to avoid being blocked.
-   **Secure API Keys:** If using APIs that require keys, ensure they are not exposed in client-side code.
-   **Optimize Requests:** Use only necessary API endpoints to reduce loading times and bandwidth usage.

## Conclusion

Using `async`/`await` simplifies dealing with asynchronous operations like API requests. It makes the code cleaner, easier to read, and maintain. By incorporating these techniques, you can efficiently manage data retrieval from various sources, enhance user interactions, and handle errors effectively in your applications.
