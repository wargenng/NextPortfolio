# Lesson 1: Introduction to JavaScript and Development Environment

#### Learning Objectives

-   Grasp the historical significance and evolution of JavaScript in web development.
-   Learn JavaScript's basic syntax and familiarize with common data types.
-   Establish a local development environment tailored for JavaScript using Visual Studio Code and Node.js.

#### History and Evolution of JavaScript

-   **Creation and Naming**: JavaScript was developed by Brendan Eich in 1995 at Netscape, initially called Mocha and then LiveScript before being renamed JavaScript.
-   **Purpose**: The language was designed to make web pages interactive, adding dynamic content that could react to user events, a groundbreaking feature at that time.
-   **Standardization**: To ensure consistent behavior across various browsers, JavaScript was standardized under the ECMAScript specification. ECMAScript standards are maintained by the Technical Committee 39 (TC39) of Ecma International.
-   **Evolution**: Over the years, JavaScript has evolved significantly, with ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) introducing major updates like arrow functions, classes, and promises, which have markedly changed how developers write JavaScript.

This first lesson sets the stage for understanding how JavaScript has become a pivotal element in web development, underlining its capabilities beyond simple client-side scripting to include comprehensive front-end and back-end applications. Setting up a robust development environment using Visual Studio Code and Node.js enables students to begin practical exercises and projects that will reinforce their learning through hands-on application of the concepts discussed.
