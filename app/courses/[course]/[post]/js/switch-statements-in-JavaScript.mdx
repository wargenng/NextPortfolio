## Switch Statements

When dealing with multiple conditions leading to different outcomes, `switch` statements offer a more structured approach:

```javascript
let coffeeSize = "large";

switch (coffeeSize) {
    case "small":
        console.log("That'll be $2");
        break;
    case "medium":
        console.log("That'll be $3");
        break;
    case "large":
        console.log("That'll be $4");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("We don't have that size");
}
```
