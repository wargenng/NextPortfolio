### Week 6: Mastering File Handling and Dictionaries in Python

Python’s versatility is on full display when handling files and using dictionaries. This week, we delve into the practical aspects of reading from and writing to files, as well as efficiently using dictionaries for data storage and retrieval. Here's how you can harness these tools to handle real-world data tasks effectively.

#### Understanding File Handling

**Why File Handling?**
File handling is essential for any programming task that requires data storage or retrieval. This could be for data analysis, saving user-generated data, or even logging application events.

**Basic File Operations:**

1. **Opening a File**: Python uses the `open()` function to open a file. The function returns a file object and takes two main parameters: the file path and the mode (`r` for reading, `w` for writing, `a` for appending, `r+` for both reading and writing).

    ```python
    file = open('example.txt', 'r')
    ```

2. **Reading from a File**: You can read the entire content using `read()` or line by line using `readline()` or `readlines()`.

    ```python
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
    ```

3. **Writing to a File**: Similar to reading, writing depends on the mode the file is opened in. Use `write()` to add text to the file.

    ```python
    file = open('example_write.txt', 'w')
    file.write("Hello Python!")
    file.close()
    ```

4. **Closing a File**: It is crucial to close a file to free up system resources.
    ```python
    file.close()
    ```

**Handling Files with Context Managers:**
Using a context manager (`with` statement) is recommended because it automatically takes care of closing the file even if an error occurs during file operations.

```python
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    print(file.read())
```

#### Using Dictionaries for Data Storage

**Why Dictionaries?**
Dictionaries in Python are incredibly efficient for key-value storage. They are ideal for data that pairs unique identifiers with specific values, such as a dictionary for storing user information where usernames are keys and user details are values.

**Operations on Dictionaries:**

-   **Creating a Dictionary**: Define keys and values directly or use the `dict()` constructor.

    ```python
    user_info = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'email': 'john@example.com'}
    ```

-   **Accessing Values**: Use the key to access the corresponding value.

    ```python
    print(user_info['name'])
    ```

-   **Adding or Modifying Entries**: Assign a value to a key directly.

    ```python
    user_info['age'] = 31  # update
    user_info['address'] = '123 Main St'  # add new
    ```

-   **Removing Entries**: Use `del` or the `pop()` method.
    ```python
    del user_info['email']
    age = user_info.pop('age')
    ```

#### Practical Exercise: Word Count Program

Let’s integrate both file handling and dictionaries by creating a program that reads a text file and counts the frequency of each word.

```python
def count_words(filepath):
    with open(filepath, 'r') as file:
        words = file.read().lower().split()
        word_count = {}
        for word in words:
            if word in word_count:
                word_count[word] += 1
            else:
                word_count[word] = 1
        return word_count

# Assuming 'example.txt' contains some text
result = count_words('example.txt')
print(result)
```

#### Example Files

To practice, you'll need some example files:

1. **Text File (example.txt)**:

    ```
    Hello Python! This is an example text file. Let's see how Python handles files.
    ```

2. **JSON File (example.json)**:
    ```json
    {
        "users": [
            { "name": "Alice", "age": 25, "email": "alice@example.com" },
            { "name": "Bob", "age": 30, "email": "bob@example.com" }
        ]
    }
    ```

These files provide a foundation for practicing Python's file operations and data manipulation techniques. Remember, the more you practice, the more proficient you’ll become!

Let's create the example text file and JSON file for you to use.

I've created the example files for you:

1. [Download the example text file](sandbox:/mnt/data/example.txt) - This file contains a sample text useful for practicing file reading and word counting exercises.
2. [Download the example JSON file](sandbox:/mnt/data/example.json) - This file is formatted in JSON and includes sample data about users, which can be useful for practicing data parsing and manipulation.

These files will help you implement and test the file handling and dictionary usage techniques discussed in the blog.
