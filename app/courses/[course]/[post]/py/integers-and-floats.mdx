**Integers and Floats**

-   **Explanation**: Discuss how numbers are used in Python, including integers and floating-point numbers.
-   **Examples**:
    ```python
    x = 5       # An integer assignment
    y = 7.3     # A floating-point number
    print(x * y)  # Multiplying an integer by a float
    ```
-   **Exercise**: Have students create variables for their age and height, then calculate and print a combined value.
