# Defining and Calling Functions in Python

Functions are a cornerstone of any programming language, allowing you to encapsulate code for tasks that need to be performed multiple times. In Python, functions are defined using the `def` keyword and called by their name followed by parentheses. Here’s a more in-depth look at each step.

### Defining a Function

#### The `def` Keyword

The `def` keyword is a statement for defining a function in Python. You start a function with `def` followed by the name of the function and parentheses `()`. Any input parameters or arguments should be placed within these parentheses. You can also define parameters inside these parentheses.

Here’s the structure of a function:

```python
def function_name(parameters):
    # code block
    return output
```

**Example:**

```python
def greet():
    print("Hello, welcome to Python functions!")
```

In this example:

-   `greet` is the name of the function.
-   The parentheses `()` indicate that `greet` does not take any parameters.
-   The function body starts with a colon `:` and is indented.

#### Function Body

The body of the function is the code block that performs the given task. It is important to maintain a consistent indentation as it defines the scope of the function.

#### Adding Documentation

It’s a good practice to add documentation to your functions using docstrings. Docstrings describe what the function does. They are enclosed in triple quotes, allowing for multiline descriptions.

**Example with docstring:**

```python
def greet():
    """
    Print a welcome message to the user.
    """
    print("Hello, welcome to Python functions!")
```

### Calling a Function

To execute the function, you call it by its name followed by parentheses. If the function requires arguments, you pass them inside the parentheses.

**Example of calling the function:**

```python
greet()  # Output: Hello, welcome to Python functions!
```

### Conclusion

Understanding how to define and call functions is crucial for organizing and reusing code in Python. By encapsulating tasks into functions, you can make your code more modular, readable, and maintainable. Practice creating functions with various types of parameters and return values to solidify your understanding of this fundamental concept.
