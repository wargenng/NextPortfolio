**Booleans and Simple Logic**

-   **Explanation**: Introduce Boolean values and their role in control flows (detailed in later lessons).
-   **Boolean operations**:
    -   Comparisons (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`)
-   **Examples**:
    ```python
    a = 5
    b = 6
    is_equal = (a == b)
    print(is_equal)  # Output will be False
    ```
-   **Exercise**: Prompt students to compare two numbers and print whether they are equal or one is larger than the other.
