**Strings**

-   **Explanation**: Cover what strings are and how they are used in Python.
-   **String operations**:
    -   Concatenation (`+`)
    -   Repetition (`*`)
-   **Examples**:
    ```python
    first_name = "John"
    last_name = "Doe"
    full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
    print("Hello, " + full_name + "!")
    ```
-   **Exercise**: Ask students to create two string variables for a favorite color and a hobby, then combine them into a sentence and print it.
