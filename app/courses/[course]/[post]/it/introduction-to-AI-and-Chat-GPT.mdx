### Part 1: Understanding AI and Chat-GPT

#### AI's Journey to Today

-   **Brief History:** From early computers to AI that can write poems! For example, the transition from IBM's Deep Blue, which beat the world chess champion, to today's AI that can generate articles.

#### What is Chat-GPT?

-   **Defining Chat-GPT:** It's like a really smart chatbot that can understand and respond in a way that feels human. Imagine asking it for homework help, and it gives you detailed, understandable explanations!
-   **How it Works:** Think of Chat-GPT as a super-advanced calculator for words. It uses patterns from a huge amount of text it has read to guess what should come next in a sentence.

#### Chat-GPT in the Real World

-   **Applications:** From writing emails to diagnosing diseases. For instance, a company might use Chat-GPT to handle customer service chats.

### Part 2: Diving Deeper into Capabilities and Customization

#### Exploring Capabilities

-   **Understanding Context & Generating Text:** Chat-GPT can keep track of a conversation's topic, just like remembering the plot of a movie you're watching. It's why when you talk to it about space, it doesn't suddenly switch to talking about cookies unless you steer it there.

#### Customizing Chat-GPT

-   **Using APIs:** Think of an API as a menu in a restaurant. You request what you want (e.g., "Make the chatbot sound more professional"), and the kitchen (Chat-GPT) prepares it for you.
-   **Simple Coding for Customization:** Imagine programming Chat-GPT is like teaching your dog tricks. You give specific commands, and it learns to respond in the way you want. For example, setting up Chat-GPT to provide tutoring in a specific subject with a tone that matches a student's learning style.

#### Hands-On Activity: Let's Play with Chat-GPT

-   **Customization Exercise:** We'll change how Chat-GPT talks. Want it to sound like Shakespeare or a friendly neighbor? Hereâ€™s where we experiment.

#### Group Brainstorm

-   **Sharing Ideas:** What's a problem you face daily that Chat-GPT could help with? It could be anything from organizing your calendar to coming up with ideas for a science project.

### Homework & Assignments

#### Reflective Assignment

-   **Essay:** How could AI change the game in education or healthcare? Think about Chat-GPT as a tutor or a medical advisor. Be creative and critical in your analysis.

#### Customization Plan

-   **Draft a Plan:** Think of a task you do often. How could Chat-GPT make it easier or more efficient? Sketch out a basic plan for a Chat-GPT customization. Example: A Chat-GPT bot that helps plan healthy meals based on what's in your fridge.

### Preparation for Next Session

-   **Ethical Thinking:** As you brainstorm your project, consider what ethical issues might arise. For example, if your project deals with personal data, how will you ensure privacy?
-   **Experiment with Chat-GPT:** Try using different platforms or tools where Chat-GPT is applied. Notice any limitations or areas where it excels.
