Hey! I’m a programmer first and foremost and a climbing addict second. I love the challenge and creativity of programming, especially solving problems that really make me think.

I am currently working as a Game Developer for [Pervasive Gaming](https://pervasivegaming.com/) where we use C#.NET to develop class 3 cabinet games. My team is in charge of the FrontEnd Game Development where we use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create our games.

I was also formerly a Business Process Analyst for the [Department of Energy](https://nnss.gov/) where I was doing data analysis using Python, Excel, SQL. I worked hand in hand with the business and the IT team for testing applications deployed by the IT team and communicating requirements that the business team had for IT.

I love JavaScript but I still have a soft spot for Data Analysis so I started tutoring for both JavaScript and Python with [Varsity Tutors](https://www.varsitytutors.com/). If you're one of my students, Hello! You can find our class notes in the [courses](/courses) tab above.

Other than programming, I'm massively addicted to climbing and editing my climbing videos. If you want to go watch, follow me on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@wargenonthewall?si=tHYCvgyFuuJsOsN-), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wargenonthewall?igsh=MXFyd2Q3eWN6MGdldA%3D%3D&utm_source=qr), and [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@wargenonthewall?_t=8lJuKJA2MVW&_r=1). I also really enjoy listening to and sharing music amongst my friends! Here's a link to my rate my music if you want to see my cold music takes check out my [rate my music](https://rateyourmusic.com/~GNNR).
