# Practical Exercise: Driving License Eligibility Program

**Objective**: Utilize Python conditional statements to determine if a user qualifies for a full or provisional driving license.

**Exercise Setup and Guidance**:

1. **Exercise Description**:

    - Students will create a Python program that requests the user's age and years of driving experience.
    - The program will assess whether the user is eligible for a full driving license, a provisional license, or if they are ineligible based on the given criteria.

2. **Requirements**:

    - **Full License**: 18 years or older with at least 2 years of driving experience.
    - **Provisional License**: 18 years or older with less than 2 years of driving experience.
    - **Ineligible**: Under 18 years old.

3. **Implementing the Program**:

    **Setup the Program**:

    - Students should begin by setting up their Python environment and creating a new script file.
    - Prompt students to write code for inputting the userâ€™s age and driving experience:
        ```python
        age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
        driving_experience = int(input("Enter your years of driving experience: "))
        ```

    **Conditional Logic**:

    - Guide students through crafting the conditional statements needed to evaluate the eligibility:
        ```python
        if age < 18:
            print("You are ineligible for a driving license.")
        else:
            if driving_experience >= 2:
                print("You qualify for a full driving license.")
            else:
                print("You qualify for a provisional driving license.")
        ```
    - Explain the use of nested `if` statements and the logic behind each decision path.

    **Test and Debug**:

    - Encourage students to test the program with various inputs to see different outcomes.
    - Highlight the importance of checking edge cases, such as exactly 18 years old or exactly 2 years of driving experience.
    - Assist students with debugging issues and answer any queries they might have.

4. **Additional Guidance**:

    - **Code Readability**: Emphasize the importance of using clear variable names and maintaining proper indentation to enhance code readability.
    - **Input Validation**: Discuss how to implement basic input validation to ensure that the inputs are logical (e.g., age and experience should not be negative).
    - **Further Development**: Encourage students to think about how they might expand the program, such as by adding more detailed user feedback or handling additional complex scenarios.

5. **Review and Discuss**:
    - Conclude the exercise by reviewing several students' codes, discussing the strengths and areas for improvement.
    - Summarize the key lessons from the exercise and how these programming skills translate to practical applications.
