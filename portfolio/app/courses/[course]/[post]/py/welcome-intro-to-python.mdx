    -   **Exercise**: Write a "Hello, World!" script and practice using comments.

### Week 2: Basic Data Types and Operations

-   **Objective**: Familiarize with Python data types and basic arithmetic operations.
-   **Activities**:
    -   Introduction to data types: integers, floats, strings, and booleans.
    -   Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
    -   String manipulation: concatenation, basic methods.
    -   **Exercise**: Create variables of different types and practice arithmetic operations. Experiment with string manipulation.

### Week 3: Control Structures: Conditional Statements

-   **Objective**: Learn to control the flow of your program using conditional statements.
-   **Activities**:
    -   Introduction to if, elif, and else statements.
    -   Understanding comparison and logical operators.
    -   **Exercise**: Write a simple program that makes decisions based on user input, such as a basic recommendation system.

### Week 4: Data Structures and Loops

-   **Objective**: Explore lists and dictionaries and understand how to control the flow with loops.
-   **Activities**:
    -   Introduction to lists and dictionaries, their creation, and basic operations.
    -   Introduction to for loops and while loops to iterate over data structures.
    -   **Exercise**: Use a list to store a series of numbers and a dictionary to store information about a person, then use loops to process these data structures.

### Week 5: Functions

-   **Objective**: Learn how to write reusable blocks of code using functions.
-   **Activities**:
    -   Defining and calling functions.
    -   Parameters and return values.
    -   **Exercise**: Write a function that performs a simple calculation, such as converting temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

### Week 6: Introduction to File Handling

-   **Objective**: Learn to work with files to read from and write data to them.
-   **Activities**:
    -   Basics of file handling: opening files, reading content, writing to files, and closing files.
    -   Working with text files.
    -   **Exercise**: Write a program that reads a text file to count the number of words and saves the count to a new file.

### Week 7: Introduction to Python Libraries: NumPy and Pandas

-   **Objective**: Learn to use powerful Python libraries for data analysis.
-   **Activities**:
    -   Introduction to NumPy: arrays, array operations.
    -   Introduction to pandas: dataframes, reading and writing data.
    -   Basic data manipulation and analysis techniques using these libraries.
    -   **Exercise**: Create a pandas dataframe from a CSV file, perform basic data cleaning, and execute simple analyses using NumPy and pandas.

### Week 8: Review and Simple Project

-   **Objective**: Consolidate learning with a review and a small project to apply the concepts learned.
-   **Activities**:
    -   Quick review of the key concepts covered in the course.
    -   Final project: Implement a small project, such as a basic data analysis application using NumPy and pandas, which can analyze and visualize data from a provided dataset.
    -   **Exercise**: Present the final project, discussing the approach, challenges faced, and solutions.
