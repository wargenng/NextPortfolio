### Week 2: Basic Data Types and Operations

-   **Objective**: Familiarize with Python data types and basic arithmetic operations.
-   **Activities**:
    -   Introduction to data types: integers, floats, strings, and booleans.
    -   Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
    -   String manipulation: concatenation, basic methods.
    -   **Exercise**: Create variables of different types and practice arithmetic operations. Experiment with string manipulation.

### Week 3: Control Structures: Conditional Statements

-   **Objective**: Learn to control the flow of your program using conditional statements.
-   **Activities**:
    -   Introduction to if, elif, and else statements.
    -   Understanding comparison and logical operators.
    -   **Exercise**: Write a simple program that makes decisions based on user input, such as a basic recommendation system.

### Week 4: Lists and Loops

-   **Objective**: Understand lists and use loops to manipulate and iterate over them.
-   **Activities**:
    -   Introduction to lists, their creation, and basic operations.
    -   Exploring for loops and while loops to process lists.
    -   Loop control statements: break, continue.
    -   **Exercise**: Create a list of items and use loops to modify, add, or remove elements; implement basic algorithms like finding the max/min item.

### Week 5: Functions

-   **Objective**: Learn how to write reusable blocks of code using functions.
-   **Activities**:
    -   Defining and calling functions.
    -   Parameters and return values.

### Week 6: File Handling and Dictionaries

-   **Objective**: Learn to work with files and explore dictionaries for storing and accessing data.
-   **Activities**:
    -   Basics of file handling: opening files, reading content, writing to files, and closing files.
    -   Introduction to dictionaries, their creation, and operations.
    -   **Exercise**: Write a program that reads a text file to count the number of words; use a dictionary to store word counts.

### Week 7: Introduction to Python Libraries: NumPy and Pandas

-   **Objective**: Learn to use powerful Python libraries for data analysis.
-   **Activities**:
    -   Introduction to NumPy: arrays, array operations.
    -   Introduction to pandas: dataframes, reading and writing data.
    -   Basic data manipulation and analysis techniques using these libraries.
    -   **Exercise**: Create a pandas dataframe from a CSV file, perform basic data cleaning, and execute simple analyses using NumPy and pandas.

### Week 8: Review and Simple Project

-   **Objective**: Consolidate learning with a review and a small project to apply the concepts learned.
-   **Activities**:
    -   Quick review of the key concepts covered in the course.
    -   Final project: Implement a small project, such as a basic data analysis application using NumPy and pandas, which can analyze and visualize data from a provided dataset.
    -   **Exercise**: Present the final project, discussing the approach, challenges faced, and solutions.
